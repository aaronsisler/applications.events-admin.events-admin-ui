# services.events-admin-ui

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Reference from older application: https://github.com/aaronsisler/clients.lawndale-manor/blob/main/src/components/contact-form/contact-form.jsx

## Review or TODO Items

- A way to trigger actions, such as logging in if the application wasn't ready yet
- Figure out the Client | undefined issue...
- Can you generate "models" from a contract?
- Should we use npm, yarn, pnpm, bun?
- Getting a "Actions on Save" working such that the file and spacing/imports all format
