This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Review or TODO Items

- Can you generate "models" from a contract?
- GitHub workflow
- Should we use npm, yarn, pnpm, bun?
- Getting a "Actions on Save" working such that the file and spacing/imports all format
